Following Hurricane Mitch in 1998, a large-scale study on 180 communities of smallholders from southern to northern Nicaragua demonstrated that farming plots cropped with simple agroecological methods (including rock bunds or dikes, green manure, crop rotation and the incorporation of stubble, ditches, terraces, barriers, mulch, legumes, trees, plowing parallel to the slope, no-burn, live fences, and zero-tillage) had on average 40 per cent more topsoil, higher field moisture, less erosion and lower economic losses than control plots on conventional farms. On average, agroecological plots lost 18 per cent less arable land to landslides than conventional plots and had 69 per cent less gully erosion compared to conventional farms.",

In all contexts, there are ongoing challenges to the inclusion of an intersectoral approach to women\u2019s full equality. Even in areas where the legal framework has advanced, or in societies with extensive and robust gender equality laws and policies, the test lies in the ability to implement progressive laws in practice. Innumerable barriers remain on many levels, not least of which is the male-controlled and discriminatory environment within which laws are operationalized. A good law requires a fully ameliorating environment in which it can be meaningfully implemented. No matter how strongly the law is drafted, it is filtered through the biases and limitations of the individuals and institutions, public and private, responsible for grounding it in reality, compounded by a social environment that disadvantages women through the perpetuation of historical discrimination, the patriarchal construction of gender and the perpetuation of stereotypes and prejudices.

In Ukraine, a draft law \"on propaganda of homosexuality\", which prohibits \"propaganda of homosexual relations\" aimed at children, was recommended in 2013 for the consideration of the parliament. This draft law defines \"propaganda\" as any public action to spread information on same-sex relations, including peaceful assemblies and educational courses. In August 2012, a Russian court upheld a Moscow city council ban on gay pride parades, prohibiting such assemblies for the next 100 years. In early 2014, the President of Nigeria signed the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, which bans gay marriage and also makes it an offence to register, operate, participate in or support gay clubs, societies, organizations, processions or meetings, or to make a public display of a same-sex amorous relationship, directly or indirectly. An offence is punishable by a prison term of 10 years. The provision effectively bans any public or private meeting on the subject of sexual orientation and gender identity. In Uganda, the President signed a new anti-homosexuality bill into law in February 2014. This law imposes a sentence of life imprisonment for homosexuality and same-sex marriage and five to seven years of imprisonment for the \"promotion\" of homosexuality, which directly targets and threatens the work of LGBTI organizations and human rights defenders. In Kuwait, the new criminal offence of \"imitating the opposite sex\" directly targets and criminalizes transgender people and anyone seen as not conforming to gender norms. It has resulted in harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, abuse, torture and sexual assault of transgender people. Expressing its concern, the Human Rights Committee has recommended that the offence be repealed (CCPR/C/KWT/CO/2, para. 30).",

Although the ICESCR General Comment 12 and other documents have underscored the non-discriminatory intention of the right to food, the archaic language of patriarchy taints the UDHR and treaty language. Concurrently the economic and social rights of the ICESCR are generally reviewed in CEDAW, but not the right to food, which is indirectly touched upon only through a call for rural women.

The Court handed down a series of resolutions which commenced in 2001 requiring State governments in India to implement food distribution programmes for the most disadvantaged.

Further, minorities may be adversely affected, for example through displacement by large-scale projects such as dams and natural resource extraction, or as a result of the negative environmental impact of such projects. As noted in the report of the independent expert on minorities, poverty and the Millennium Development Goals, conflict prevention is one reason why monitoring poverty alleviation among persons belonging to minorities is crucial: if strategies are successful for some groups but not for minorities, inequalities will increase and so too may tension. Inclusive participation strategies for poverty reduction are proven and effective conflict prevention measures (see A/HRC/4/9, para. 43).",

If children attend school, they are less likely to join armed forces or groups because they have other alternatives. In contrast, a lack of access to education leads many young people to see military training as their only opportunity to provide for themselves and their families. In situations of armed conflict, when the protective function of schools is most required, schools often become targets for attacks. The use of schools for military purposes equally reduces the likelihood of children attending school. All stakeholders must therefore ensure that schools are protected. Measures that field-based practitioners in conflict settings have used to prevent schools from being attacked include physical protection, community involvement in protection of schools, alternative delivery of education, negotiations with stakeholders to make schools zones of peace, restrictions on the military and political use of schools, and advocacy initiatives.",

The former are more visible to authorities, easier to distinguish from the local population, and delivery of services is rendered logistically simpler than when communities are dispersed. In the case of persons displaced due to generalised violence and armed conflict, it has been found that \"in countries where IDPs were living in both gathered and dispersed settings, national authorities and humanitarian actors were twice as likely to provide assistance and protection to IDPs in gathered settings than to those in dispersed settings\"",

In the report a number of recommendations were presented to States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations for better protecting education and ensuring its inclusion as an integral part of the humanitarian response to conflicts and natural disasters.",

The initiative was presented at the thirty-ninth plenary session of CFS in October 2012, and to the Social Protection Inter-Agency Cooperation Board, as well as in various other forums.

The Commission expresses concern that the lack of access to safe drinking water particularly affects women and girls and that they frequently bear the burden for its collection in rural and urban areas, and further recognizes the need for further improvement in this regard. The Commission further notes that the lack of adequate sanitation facilities disproportionately affects women and girls, including their labour force and school participation rates, and increases their vulnerability to violence.

In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Domestic Workers Convention (ILO Convention No. 189) entered into force in September 2013.

With some 250 million people and a third of the Earth's land surface affected by desertification, the parties to the Convention have recently made significant strides towards addressing this challenge in the context of food security and climate change. Given that more than 75 per cent of the world's poorest people live in rural areas and that 2.5 billion people live on small farms and are entirely dependent on agriculture for their survival, the fact that 30 per cent of the Earth's surface is affected by the degradation of fragile drylands poses a significant problem.

This is further complicated by the secrecy surrounding witchcraft and the resulting difficulty in identifying its real practitioners in all cases. These matters raise the question of whether and how these occupations ought to be defined and regulated as a means of preventing human rights violations allegedly and actually committed by their practitioners. There is also the issue of whether witchcraft beliefs should be given any form of legal character or recognition when it is largely a supernatural phenomenon. Often, these issues are further complicated by the fact that many legal instruments addressing witchcraft are outdated and disconnected from current social realities.",

In destination countries, the exploitation of migrant workers often takes place in the context of economic activity that is illegal or informal, or poorly regulated or unregulated, or in sectors in which it is difficult to enforce regulatory controls and profit margins are extremely low (CTOC/COP/WG.4/2010/3/para. 15). Indeed, studies show that the demand for exploitative labour or services is almost completely absent where workers are well unionized and labour standards are routinely monitored and enforced. Therefore, it is imperative to address the demand for cheap and exploitable labour and services through the framework of labour rights protection and migration management. A good example of regulation in sectors where trafficked persons are found is the introduction by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act in 2004, which created a compulsory licensing system for all employment agents supplying workers for agricultural activities, gathering shellfish and related processing and packaging activities, supervised by a special licensing authority. Thus, reforming employment laws to check abuses in sectors that have formerly gone unpoliced, such as domestic work in private houses or training and deploying labour inspectors or other officials to check the contracts and working conditions of migrant workers is imperative for preventing trafficking for exploitative labour.",

The authors of a World Bank study on the economic effect of adopting or enforcing the two core labour rights mentioned above reported \"very robust\" findings that unions compress wage inequality. In particular, they found that the wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers were reduced when unions were present. This is consistent with another study, in relation to the United States, in which the authors concluded: \nWhen individual union membership is considered, union decline accounts for a fifth of the growth in men's earnings inequality. Adding normative and threat effects of unions on nonunion pay increases the effect of union decline on wage inequality from a fifth to a third. By this measure, the decline of the U.S. labor movement has added as much to men's wage inequality as has the relative increase in pay for college graduates. \nA 2013 study about Turkey shows that the fall of unionization in that country resulted in higher wage inequality during the period 1980-2008. Also relevant is the evidence that not only does deunionization affect wage inequality, but wage inequality also affects unionization.",

In recent years, however, the main debate has been between those who support what are termed \"social safety net\" approaches and those who seek \"social inclusion\" and acknowledge \"social citizenship\". The principal response of the World Bank to the backlash against the austerity and adjustment policies of the Washington Consensus was to advocate social safety nets. The concept of social risk management gained special prominence, both as a means to protect the basic livelihood of the most vulnerable, or those living in chronic poverty, and to promote better managed risk-taking in response to economic and other shocks. However, the safety net approach was also widely criticized for failing to devote enough attention to structural poverty and inequality, and for its emphasis on the narrow targeting of groups for assistance. In response, rights-based approaches were promoted, not only within the human rights community, but by a broader range of development scholars and institutions. But the general debate is far from settled and critics argue that many of today's approaches to social protection continue to show a \"bias towards more ameliorative and less transformative approaches to social protection, which are likely to leave the underlying causes of injustice in place.\"",

There are many varying ways to improve transparency depending on the context. For example, transparency in procurement is enhanced through public access to procurement bidding results, monitoring of the prices paid and analysis of bids. Transparency in recruitment can be supported through the publication of criteria. Transparency through the promotion of information that sets out the services and treatments to which individuals are entitled and how these services are reimbursed can help minimize inequalities in access to care through corrupt practices. The publication of transparent waiting lists can negate the practice of bribery to access more rapid treatment",

Beyond that example, recent research shows that countries that have made significant progress in reducing malnutrition present a number of common characteristics. First, they sought to adopt a multisectoral approach to combating hunger and malnutrition. Their strategies combined attention to agriculture, with the mainstreaming of nutrition in health-care policies, and coordinated policies in the areas of education, gender, water, sanitation and habitat, pro-poor economic development (both through employment and income generation for the poor and through social development), and trade. Second, in almost all cases, the political impetus at the highest level of government was a key factor. Change was achieved after Governments placed food and nutrition security at the top of the political agenda and adopted strategies specifically aimed at combating hunger and poverty. Third, civil society participation and empowerment were essential, contributing to the sustainability of policies across time and improving their acceptance and impact among affected populations. Fourth, multiphased approaches were the most effective, as allowed by multi-year national strategies combining both short-term interventions and long-term approaches to nutrition. Fifth, the establishment of institutions monitoring progress ensured that the political pressure remained present throughout the implementation phase of the strategy and that the resources were committed. Sixth, the continuity of financial investment from national resources, supplemented with external matching funds, was vital: one-time efforts, over short periods, failed to achieve significant impact.",

The globalization process has, in some countries, resulted in policy shifts in favour of more open trade and financial flows, privatization of State-owned enterprises and in many cases lower public spending, particularly on social services. This change has transformed patterns of production and accelerated technological advances in information and communication and affected the lives of women, both as workers and consumers. In a large number of countries, particularly in developing and least developed countries, these changes have also adversely impacted on the lives of women and have increased inequality. The gender impact of these changes has not been systematically evaluated. Globalization also has cultural, political and social impacts affecting cultural values, lifestyles and forms of communication as well as implications for the achievement of sustainable development. The benefits of the growing global economy have been unevenly distributed, leading to wider economic disparities, the feminization of poverty, increased gender inequality, including through often deteriorating work conditions and unsafe working environments, especially in the informal economy and rural areas. While globalization has brought greater economic opportunities and autonomy to some women, many others have been marginalized and deprived of the benefits of this process, owing to deepening inequalities among and within countries. Although in many countries the level of participation of women in the labour force has risen, in other cases the application of certain economic policies has had such a negative impact that increases in women's employment often have not been matched by improvements in wages, promotions and working conditions. In many cases, women continue to be employed in low-paid part-time and contract jobs marked by insecurity and by safety and health hazards. In many countries, women, especially new entrants into the labour market, continue to be among the first to lose jobs and the last to be rehired.",
